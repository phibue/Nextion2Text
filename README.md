# Nextion to Text Converter

## Description

This script creates a text file for each page of your Nextion GUI, containing all components of the page, including their properties and the entire source code.

This tool was mainly created to get meaningfull commit diffs (which is not possible with the binary HMI file) and to allow you to share *your* source code with other people as easily as developpers are used to. Binary files are simply impractical for developpment and sharing.

This tool can NOT convert text back to a .HMI file. 

## Usage

The script is written in Python, v3.8. No additional modules are required. 
The script offers a couple options to customize its behavior and output. You can get a full description of all command line options with

```python Nextion2Text.py -h```

For most basic usage, simply run

```python Nextion2Text.py -i PATH_TO_HMI_FILE -o FOLDER_FOR_TEXT_FILES```

Note that by default, visual properties (x/y position, colors, pictures, fonts, ...) are *not* included, see example links below.

## Features and Limitations

Supports all Nextion components, including the Intelligent series components. 

However, Intelligent series attributes are only partially supported by now. You can use the `--properties unknown` (See command line help for more details) option to include unknown attributes, too. 

## Example

The [Example folder](/Example) contains a HMI file, a subfolder with the resultung text files, and a `.cmd` file that has been executed to generate the text files. In addition, here are some interesting commits you may want to look at:
